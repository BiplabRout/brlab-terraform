1. terraform init :

   download the provider packages to our local folder ".terraform" from terraform as mentioned in the "terraform setting" block


2. terraform plan :

   2.1 : set the planning of the infra, where first it will do refresh of current state(state of resource in the actual cloud platform)
        and the terraform state file .
        It means it will also do a "terraform refresh" internally for every resource., but "tfstate" file will not be updated actually.
        so will not see any changes to tfstate file unless we don't di terraform apply.

   2.2 : terraform plan -refresh=false : will not do refresh for any for the resources
   2.3 : terraform plan will refresh it but will not update the "tfstate" file . these file will only be updated by terraform apply
   2.4 : terraform plan -var <variable-name> = <variable-value>
         terraform plan -var-file <variable-filename>.tfvars
         terraform plan -refresh=false

3. terraform refresh :

    It will update the changes in the tfsate file which are detected between current state and tfstate file.


4. terraform apply :

    4.1 : apply the resources to platform.
          It will also do the same activity as "terraform plan" does before deploying the resources

    4.2 : "terraform apply -auto-approve"  : it will not prompt for final approval


5. terraform destroy :

    4.1 : destroy the resources from platform.
          It will also do the same activity as "terraform plan" does before destroying the resources

    4.2 : "terraform destroy -auto-approve"  : it will not prompt for final approval
